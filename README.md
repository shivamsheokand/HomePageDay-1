Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! 🚀 This project marks Day 1, where I've built a simple React home page as a part of my journey to improve as a full-stack developer.

Description
This project represents the initial step in my 100-day challenge, focusing on mastering React and improving my front-end development skills. The goal of today's work was to create a basic, responsive home page using React components and JSX.

Features
React Components: Utilized React's component-based architecture to create a modular and maintainable structure.
Basic Styling: Added minimal styling to the home page using tailwind and/or styled-components.
Technologies Used
React
Tailwind
