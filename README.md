# React Home Page - Day 1 of 100 Days Coding Challenge

## Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! ðŸš€

This project marks Day 1, where I've built a simple React home page as a part of my journey to improve as a full-stack developer.

### Description

This project represents the initial step in my 100-day challenge, focusing on mastering React and improving my front-end development skills. The goal of today's work was to create a basic, responsive home page using React components and JSX.

### Features

- **React Components:** Utilized React's component-based architecture to create a modular and maintainable structure.
- **Basic Styling:** Added minimal styling to the home page using Tailwind CSS and/or styled-components.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamsheokand/HomePageDay-1.git
   ```

Install Dependencies:

 ```bash
cd HomePageDay-1
npm install
```
Run the App:

```bash

npm start
```
View the App:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the React home page.
